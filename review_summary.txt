The `README.md` file was reviewed for clarity, conciseness, accuracy, user-friendliness, and formatting after the initial round of updates.

Overall, the README was found to be in good shape and accurately reflected the plugin's functionality as outlined in `review_notes.txt` and the previous updates.

One minor change was made for improved clarity and conciseness in the "Commands" section:
- The description for the "**Create or Update Belonging Note**" command was rephrased from:
  "Create or refresh the parent note for the current note. This also updates the belonging note for the current file's stream."
  to:
  "Creates or refreshes the belonging (parent) note associated with the currently active note's stream and date."

No other formatting or significant content issues were identified. The document is considered clear, user-friendly, and accurate based on the information available.
